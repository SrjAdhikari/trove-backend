# Storage Usage & Quota

> **Status:** As-built (2026-06-14). Per-user storage quota + the usage-breakdown endpoint, shipped in PR #66.

This document covers the per-user storage quota: where the limit lives, how usage is read, how the quota is enforced on upload, and the `GET /api/storage/usage` endpoint that powers the frontend's sidebar storage bar and settings storage tab.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Quota storage** — the limit is a field on the user (`User.storageLimit`, `src/models/user.model.js`), defaulting to **1 GB** (`DEFAULT_STORAGE_LIMIT = 1 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000`, decimal, matching the per-file cap convention). It is per-user, so an admin can raise it on a single account later.
- **Usage source** — usage is **not** stored separately. It is read from the denormalized root-directory `size` (the whole-subtree byte total maintained inside the upload/delete transactions since PR #62 — see `./transaction-patterns.md`). This makes "bytes used" an O(1) read of one document.
- **Controller (`src/controllers/storage.controller.js`)** — `getStorageUsageHandler` extracts `req.user._id` and `req.user.storageLimit` (the limit rides on the session-populated user, so no extra DB read) and delegates to the service.
- **Service (`src/services/storage.service.js`)** — `getStorageUsage(userId, totalStorageLimit)` reads the root size, scans the user's files for the category breakdown, and returns the response shape. No HTTP concerns.
- **Category helper (`src/utils/fileCategories.js`)** — `categorizeExtension(ext)` maps a file extension to one of `Documents` / `Images` / `Videos` / `Audio` / `Archives` / `Other`; `CATEGORY_ICONS` maps each category to a Lucide icon name for the frontend.

## 🛣️ API Endpoints

### 1. Get Storage Usage

- **Route:** `GET /api/storage/usage`
- **Authentication:** Required (session-based; router-wide `storageRouter.use(authenticate)`, rate-limited with the `read` tier).
- **Flow:**
  1. `authenticate` validates the session and populates `req.user`.
  2. Controller passes `req.user._id` + `req.user.storageLimit` to `getStorageUsage`.
  3. Service reads the user's root directory (`Directory.findOne({ userId, parentDirId: null }).select("size").lean()`); `used` = `root.size` (or `0` if the user has no root yet).
  4. Service scans the user's files (`File.find({ userId }).select("extension size").lean()`) and sums bytes per category in memory with a single `reduce` — **no aggregation pipeline** (a deliberate simplicity choice; the same denormalized-read philosophy as folder size).
  5. The breakdown is built from the category map: only categories that actually have files are included, sorted by `size` descending, each annotated with its Lucide icon.
  6. Returns `{ used, total, breakdown }`.

- **Response — 200:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Storage usage retrieved successfully",
    "data": {
      "used": 575703552,
      "total": 1000000000,
      "breakdown": [
        { "category": "Documents", "size": 314572800, "icon": "file-text" },
        { "category": "Images", "size": 209715200, "icon": "image" },
        { "category": "Other", "size": 51415552, "icon": "file" }
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  - `used` is the authoritative byte total (the same value enforcement checks against on upload).
  - `total` is the user's quota in bytes.
  - `breakdown` is empty (`[]`) for a user with no files.

## 🛡️ Quota Enforcement on Upload

The quota is enforced in `uploadFile` (`src/services/file.service.js`) — see `../file/file-upload.md` for the full upload flow. The non-obvious parts:

- **Checked inside the upload transaction.** After the bytes are streamed to disk and the final count is known, the transaction reads the current root `size` and rejects with `STORAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (400) if `usedBytes + uploadedBytes > storageLimit`, before creating the `File` row.
- **Concurrency-safe without a lock.** The same transaction also `$inc`s the root document (via `updateAncestorDirectoryStats`). Two simultaneous uploads therefore write-conflict on the root doc; `withTransaction` retries the loser, which re-reads the now-updated `size` and re-checks — so the cap holds even under concurrent uploads. (Details in `./transaction-patterns.md`.)
- **Boundary:** the check uses a strict `>`, so an upload that exactly fills the quota is allowed, and a 0-byte upload at an exactly-full quota is allowed.

## 🔄 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

| Scenario | Outcome |
| -------- | ------- |
| User with no files | `used: 0`, `breakdown: []`, `total` = their quota |
| File whose extension isn't recognised, or has no extension | Counted under the `Other` category |
| 0-byte file | Surfaces its category in the breakdown with `size: 0` |
| Upload would exceed the quota | Rejected with `STORAGE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` (400); no DB row, partial disk file removed |
| Two concurrent uploads near the limit | One commits; the other write-conflicts on the root doc, retries against the fresh size, and is accepted or rejected correctly |
| `used` vs `sum(breakdown)` | Both derive from the same files; in rare denormalization drift `used` (root size) is treated as authoritative |

## 🧹 Database Mechanisms

- **`User.storageLimit`** (`Number`, required, default 1 GB) — see `./database-schema.md`. Mirrored in the Atlas `$jsonSchema` as a typed property but **not** in the validator's `required` array (the Mongoose default guarantees presence on every ORM write; listing it would reject documents created before the field existed).
- No new collection or index — usage rides on the existing denormalized `Directory.size`.

## 🔀 Deferred

Google Drive imports do **not** yet count against the quota — the import path calls `uploadFile` without a limit, so they are not enforced. Tracked as a follow-up (GitHub issue #65).
