# Google Drive Import

> **Status:** Design / pre-implementation (2026-04-22). This document describes the intended architecture for the `POST /api/drive/import` feature. No code for this feature is in the repo yet — update this doc with "as-built" notes once implementation lands.

Lets a signed-in user pick files and folders from their Google Drive and copy them into TroveCloud, preserving the folder hierarchy. One-shot, selective import — not a persistent Drive sync.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

A single new endpoint (`POST /api/drive/import`) accepts a short-lived access token obtained on the frontend via Google Identity Services, plus a list of file / folder IDs the user picked in Google Picker. The backend copies each picked item into the authenticated user's TroveCloud tree on behalf of the user, then discards the access token.

Keeping the access token ephemeral (no persistence, no `refresh_token` in the DB) matches the existing codebase's "no token storage" philosophy for OAuth — same as Google sign-in (`src/lib/googleAuth.js`) and GitHub sign-in (`src/lib/githubAuth.js`).

---

## 🧭 Design Decisions

- **Scope: one-shot pick-and-import.** The access token is passed per request. No persistence, no `refresh_token` storage, no User-schema changes.
- **Google-native files** (Docs / Sheets / Slides) are converted to Office formats (`.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`) via Drive's `export` endpoint. Unsupported native types (Forms, Drawings, Jamboards, Sites, Shortcuts) are reported as failures in the response.
- **OAuth scope: `drive.file`.** Drive API only sees items the user explicitly picked via Google Picker. Google Identity Services on the frontend obtains the token; the backend never exchanges codes and never sees the Google client secret.
- **Drive API client: raw `fetch`.** Consistent with `src/lib/githubAuth.js` — no `googleapis` SDK dependency.
- **URL choice:** `/api/drive/import` for now. If additional providers (Dropbox, OneDrive) land later, re-scope to `/api/imports/{provider}`.

## 🛣️ API Contract

### Endpoint

`POST /api/drive/import` — gated by the `authenticate` middleware.

### Request body

```
{
  accessToken: string,                     // short-lived, from Google Identity Services
  items: Array<{ id, mimeType, name? }>,   // from Google Picker
  parentDirId?: string                     // optional; defaults to user.rootDirId
}
```

### Response

Returns HTTP `200` for any non-fatal outcome — partial success is a valid result, so the caller inspects the body to see what succeeded and what failed:

```
{
  success: true,
  message: "Import completed",
  data: {
    imported: [{ driveId, troveId, name, kind: "file" | "folder" }],
    failed:   [{ driveId, name, reason }]   // reason is an appErrorCode value
  }
}
```

Malformed input (missing / wrong-type body fields) still returns `400 INVALID_INPUT` via the global error handler.

---

## 🔄 Per-Item Processing Flow

For each picked item:

1. **Re-fetch metadata from Drive.** The client-supplied `mimeType` is not trusted — users could spoof.
2. **Early reject**: trashed items, files over the per-file size cap, or items whose recursion depth would exceed the cap.
3. **Folder** (`application/vnd.google-apps.folder`) → create a TroveCloud `Directory`, paginate children via `files.list`, recurse depth-first.
4. **Google-native** → look up the export MIME in `GOOGLE_APPS_EXPORT_MAP`. If not mapped (Forms, Drawings, Shortcuts, etc.), push to `failed` with `UNSUPPORTED_DRIVE_TYPE`.
5. **Regular file** → call the Drive download endpoint, wrap `response.body` as a Node Readable (`Readable.fromWeb`), and pass to the existing `uploadFile` service.
6. **Track cumulative bytes.** Once aggregate exceeds the per-request cap, short-circuit remaining items with `DRIVE_IMPORT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

Per-item processing runs inside a `try / catch`: any failure pushes the item to `failed` with a reason code and moves on. Partial success is the user-facing contract.

---

## 🧱 File Layout

### New files

**`src/lib/googleDrive.js`** — raw-fetch wrapper around Drive REST, mirroring `src/lib/githubAuth.js` (AbortSignal timeout, explicit User-Agent, `response.ok` checks, AppError-passthrough catch).

Exports:

- `getDriveFileMetadata(accessToken, fileId)` — `GET /drive/v3/files/{fileId}?fields=id,name,mimeType,size,parents,trashed,shortcutDetails`
- `downloadDriveFile(accessToken, fileId)` — returns the `fetch` `Response` so the caller can read `.body` as a Web stream
- `exportGoogleDoc(accessToken, fileId, exportMimeType)` — returns `Response`
- `listDriveFolderChildren(accessToken, folderId, pageToken?)` — `GET /drive/v3/files?q='{folderId}' in parents and trashed=false&fields=files(id,name,mimeType,size),nextPageToken&pageSize=100`

Module-level constants:

- `DRIVE_FETCH_TIMEOUT_MS = 15000` (Drive is slower than GitHub — the GitHub wrapper uses 8s)
- `DRIVE_USER_AGENT = "TroveCloud"`
- `GOOGLE_APPS_EXPORT_MAP`:
  ```
  "application/vnd.google-apps.document"     → { mime: "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", ext: ".docx" }
  "application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet"  → { mime: "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet",       ext: ".xlsx" }
  "application/vnd.google-apps.presentation" → { mime: "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation", ext: ".pptx" }
  ```

Error mapping in the shared catch:

| HTTP status                                   | Maps to                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `401`                                         | `INVALID_DRIVE_TOKEN`                                             |
| `404`                                         | `DRIVE_ITEM_NOT_FOUND`                                            |
| `403` with `"exportSizeLimitExceeded"` reason | `DRIVE_EXPORT_TOO_LARGE` (Docs / Slides ≥10 MB can't be exported) |
| `403` quota / rate                            | `DRIVE_IMPORT_FAILED` (generic message; no internals leaked)      |
| Network / JSON parse / other                  | `DRIVE_IMPORT_FAILED`                                             |

**Token hygiene:** the `accessToken` is never included in any `AppError` message or `console.error` output. Dev-mode logging must redact tokens before emitting.

**`src/services/drive.service.js`** — orchestrator.

Exports `importFromDrive(userId, accessToken, items, parentDirId)`:

- Resolves `parentDirId` to `user.rootDirId` if omitted. Parent-ownership is validated implicitly by `createDirectory`'s existing check — no extra query needed at the top level.
- Deduplicates `items` by `id`. Also maintains a `seen: Set<driveId>` across folder traversal, so picking a folder AND a file inside that folder imports the file once.
- Iterates items sequentially. This keeps Drive API quota (1000 req / 100s / user) safe for the MVP. Can be parallelized with `p-limit` later if p95 import latency becomes a problem.

Internal helpers:

- `importItem(ctx, driveId, targetParentDirId, depth)` — metadata fetch, type branching, recursion, streaming. `ctx = { userId, accessToken, totalBytes, caps, imported, failed, seen }`.
- `sanitizeDirName(name)` — trims, strips control chars, pads names shorter than 3 chars with `_` suffix, truncates over 50, falls back to `"Imported folder"` if empty. Needed because `Directory.name` has `minlength: 3, maxlength: 50` but Drive folder names aren't bounded.
- `sanitizeFileName(name)` — same treatment against `File.name` constraints (no minlength today; still strip control chars and cap at 255, matching the existing `file.controller.js` sanitization).

**Streaming to disk:** Drive's response body arrives as a Web ReadableStream. It is wrapped in a `Transform` that counts bytes and aborts the pipeline when the post-hoc total exceeds the per-file cap — necessary because Google-native `export` responses have no pre-flight `size`. The counter-wrapped Readable is then passed to the existing `uploadFile(parentDirId, userId, displayName, readable)` in `src/services/file.service.js`, which already handles the DB row creation, disk write, and rollback on pipeline failure.

**`src/controllers/drive.controller.js`** — thin HTTP handler.

Exports `importDriveHandler(req, res)`. Validation is inline (matching the existing controller pattern; Zod-based request validation is tracked separately):

- `const { accessToken, items, parentDirId } = req.body ?? {};`
- `typeof accessToken !== "string" || !accessToken` → `INVALID_DRIVE_TOKEN`
- `accessToken.length > 4096` → `INVALID_DRIVE_TOKEN` (defensive sanity cap)
- `!Array.isArray(items) || items.length === 0 || items.length > 50` → `INVALID_INPUT`
- Each item: `typeof item.id === "string" && typeof item.mimeType === "string"` — otherwise `INVALID_INPUT`
- `parentDirId` optional; if present, must be a string. Real ObjectId validation happens inside `createDirectory`.

Response: always `200` unless input itself is malformed. Body per the contract above.

**`src/routes/drive.routes.js`** — route registration.

```js
driveRouter.use(authenticate);
driveRouter.post("/import", importDriveHandler);
```

### Modified files

- **`src/routes/index.js`** — mount `driveRouter` under `/api/drive`.
- **`src/constants/appErrorCode.js`** — add the following codes under a new `// Drive` section: `INVALID_DRIVE_TOKEN`, `DRIVE_ITEM_NOT_FOUND`, `DRIVE_IMPORT_FAILED`, `UNSUPPORTED_DRIVE_TYPE`, `DRIVE_EXPORT_TOO_LARGE`, `DRIVE_IMPORT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

### Files explicitly not changed

- **`src/models/user.model.js`** — no token storage. The User schema is untouched.
- **No new env vars.** The Google client secret stays on the frontend; the backend never exchanges codes.
- **No new dependencies.** Raw `fetch` against Drive's REST API is sufficient.

## 🧩 Edge Cases

- **Trashed items** — skipped via `trashed=false` on list queries; the metadata check rejects trashed picked items explicitly.
- **Shortcuts** (`application/vnd.google-apps.shortcut`) — rejected as `UNSUPPORTED_DRIVE_TYPE` for MVP. Following a shortcut would require an extra permission check against the target; out of scope.
- **Google-native export 10 MB cap** — Drive's `/export` endpoint returns `403 exportSizeLimitExceeded` for large Docs / Slides. Mapped to `DRIVE_EXPORT_TOO_LARGE` with a user-facing reason.
- **`size` field as string** — Drive API returns `size` as a JSON string (64-bit int). Coerce via `Number()` before comparing against the cap.
- **Zero-byte files** — allowed (the cap comparison is `>= 0`).
- **Short / long folder names** — the sanitizer reconciles the `3..50` Mongoose constraint with Drive folder names, which aren't bounded.
- **Name collisions** — `File.name` has no uniqueness index today; duplicates are silently allowed during manual upload. The import mirrors that behavior.
- **Dedup across picks** — picking a folder AND a file inside that folder imports the file once, thanks to the `seen` set.
- **Empty folder after partial failure** — the folder is created; children fail; the folder stays. Matches the "partial success" UX contract and is consistent with per-item semantics.

---

## 🚧 Explicit Non-Goals

These are deliberately out of scope for the initial implementation. Each represents a future follow-up, not an oversight.

- **Persistent Drive linking / re-import.** No `refresh_token` storage. Would require a dedicated "Link Drive" flow and User-schema changes.
- **Progress streaming (SSE / WebSocket).** Synchronous response for MVP. Watch for it if p95 exceeds ~10s with real data (a 500 MB import at Drive's ~20 MB/s is ~25s). Confirm any reverse-proxy idle timeout is > 60s before shipping.
- **Per-user total-storage cap.** Doesn't exist anywhere in the app yet. Drive import multiplies that risk — call it out in the PR description when this lands.
- **Rate-limit retry / backoff.** Drive allows 1000 queries / 100s / user. No exponential backoff for MVP — `403 userRateLimitExceeded` bubbles up as `DRIVE_IMPORT_FAILED`. Add retry if real quota pressure appears.
- **Shared-drive semantics.** `fields=parents` may be empty for shared-drive items — don't rely on it. Otherwise the feature works transparently since `drive.file` scope covers picked items regardless of ownership.
- **Client-disconnect cleanup.** If the client disconnects mid-import, the in-flight `uploadFile` rolls back its own partial file, but directories already created stay. Acceptable given per-item semantics.

## ✅ Verification

### Manual end-to-end

1. Configure a Google Cloud OAuth client with `drive.file` scope and authorized JavaScript origins pointing at the frontend.
2. On the frontend, use Google Identity Services `initTokenClient` + Google Picker to obtain an `accessToken` and the selected items.
3. Send a request:
   ```bash
   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:{PORT}/api/drive/import \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -b "token=<signed session cookie>" \
     -d '{ "accessToken": "...", "items": [{ "id": "...", "mimeType": "..." }] }'
   ```
4. Confirm: files appear under `storage/` on disk; `Directory` and `File` rows exist in Mongo; response body matches the contract.

### Scenarios to cover

- Single regular file (e.g., `.pdf`) — imports; response shows `imported.length === 1`.
- Google Doc — arrives as `.docx`; opens cleanly in Word / LibreOffice.
- Google Sheet — arrives as `.xlsx`.
- Google Slides — arrives as `.pptx`.
- Folder with 3 nested subfolders + files at each level — hierarchy preserved in TroveCloud.
- Forms / Drawings — reported as `UNSUPPORTED_DRIVE_TYPE` in `failed`; `imported` untouched.
- Shortcut — `UNSUPPORTED_DRIVE_TYPE`.
- Trashed item — `DRIVE_ITEM_NOT_FOUND` (or an explicit trashed reason).
- File > 100 MB — `failed` with size reason.
- Oversize Google Doc (forces `exportSizeLimitExceeded` from Drive) — `DRIVE_EXPORT_TOO_LARGE`.
- Expired / tampered access token — `401` from Drive → `INVALID_DRIVE_TOKEN`; no partial data in DB or on disk.
- Dedup: pick folder `A` AND `A/file.pdf` explicitly — `file.pdf` appears once.
- Items length 0 or > 50 — `400 INVALID_INPUT`.
- No session cookie — `401` from `authenticate`.
- Aggregate limit: pick files summing > 500 MB — early items import, later items fail with `DRIVE_IMPORT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

### Security audit items

- Grep the codebase post-implementation for `console.log` / `console.error` statements that might interpolate `accessToken`. Redact anything that does.
- Confirm `express.json()` body limit accommodates 50 Picker items (a few KB each — well under the default 100 KB).
- Confirm the global error handler doesn't expose `err.stack` in production (already the case — gated on `NODE_ENV !== "development"`).
